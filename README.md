## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I like to write bash scripts and small programs to accomplish tasks, I hope to get a career in streaming someday.
My flagship software is {[streamonline, a livestream checker](https://github.com/40476/streamonline)} and I have a deep interest in vtubing and streaming (something I am unable to do due to network limitations).
